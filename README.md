# MARS/WARS Software Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Build

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment
The site will auto deploy new content when there is a push/merge on `main`. Ensure your content builds before merging to main.
