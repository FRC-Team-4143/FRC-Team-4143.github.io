# MARS/WARS Software Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Build

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

```bash
npm run build
```
