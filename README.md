    - A restart may be required after updating.
    ```bash
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Path\to\nodejs
    ```

- Install docusaurus
    ```bash
    npm install -g docusaurus
    npm install
    ```
- Start the development server
    - The site can now be viewed with changes made live at `http://localhost:3000/`
    ```bash
    npx docusaurus start
    ```

## Build
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

```bash 
npm run build
```

## Remote Deployment
The site will auto deploy new content when there is a push/merge on `main`. Ensure your content builds before merging to main.
