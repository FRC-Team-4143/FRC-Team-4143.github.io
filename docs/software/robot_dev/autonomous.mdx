# Autonomous
Autonomous programming is a critical aspect of FRC robots, as it covers the first 15 seconds of the match where the robot operates without human intervention. During this period,
the robot must perform a series of pre-programmed actions to score points, navigate the field, and interact with game pieces. Effective autonomous routines can provide a significant
advantage in matches, as they allow the robot to maximize the points scored during this crucial phase where activity scores are higher.
