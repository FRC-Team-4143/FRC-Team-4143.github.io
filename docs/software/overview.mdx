# Software Docs

Welcome to the software documentation for the MARS/WARS robotics team! This documentation covers everything you need to know about programming and software development for our robots.

## Getting Started
If you are looking to start programming for the team, it is important to join our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/FRC-Team-4143).
Once you have created a GitHub account, reach out to a mentor to get added to the organization.

We have a training curriculum to get started with learning the necessary skills for programming our robots. An overview of the training curriculum can be found [here](./training). This program will walk you through the basics of programming, as well as more advanced topics such as computer vision and control theory. It is intended to be completed over the course of a few weeks, with each section building on the previous one. No prior programming experience is required, but a willingness to learn and a passion for robotics is essential!
