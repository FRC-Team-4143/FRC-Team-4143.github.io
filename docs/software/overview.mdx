# Software Docs

Welcome to the software documentation for the MARS/WARS robotics team! This documentation covers everything you need to know about programming and software development for our robots.

## Getting Started
If you are looking to start programming for the team, it is important to join our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/FRC-Team-4143).
Once you have created a GitHub account, reach out to a mentor to get added to the organization.
