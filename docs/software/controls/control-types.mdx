# Control Theory
Control theory is a branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems. Its main goal is to develop models and control strategies that ensure desired system behavior. Below are some key concepts and terms used in control theory.

- **Setpoint**: Desired value or state for system to reach. Is typically some real world measurable value.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint:::highlight
    ```
- **Computer/Controller**: Primary control unit for the system. Performs all calculations for desired command based of the requested setpoint.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer:::highlight
    ```
- **Motor/Actuator**: Actuator for the system that is used to change the current state of the system.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor:::highlight
    ```
- **Output**: Effect the control has on the system. The reaction of the system from the applied command to the motor.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output:::highlight
    ```
- **Sensor**: Device that measures the true output of the system. Allows you to checking what is happening and react instead of instructing the system blindly.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
        Output --> Sensor:::highlight
    ```
- **Measurement**: The measurement of the system is the actual reading of its condition at the given time.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
        Output --> Measurement:::highlight

        state Sensor {
            direction LR
            Measurement
        }
    ```
- **Error**: Difference between the setpoint and the sensor measurement. This is what the controller uses to determine how to adjust the output.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Error
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
        Output --> Measurement
        Measurement --> Error:::highlight

        state Sensor {
            direction LR
            Measurement
        }

        state Computer {
            direction LR
            Error
        }
    ```

## Open Loop
Open loop control is a type of control system where the output is not fed back to the input for correction. In other words, the controller sends commands to the actuator without considering the actual output of the system. This type of control is simpler and easier to implement, but it can be less accurate and more susceptible to disturbances.
```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
    ```
- Feed Forward Control

## Closed Loop
Closed loop control is a type of control system where the output is fed back to the input for correction. The controller continuously monitors the output and adjusts the input commands to minimize the error between the setpoint and the actual output. This type of control is more complex but can provide better accuracy and stability.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR

        Setpoint --> Error
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
        Output --> Measurement
        Measurement --> Error

        state Sensor {
            direction LR
            Measurement
        }

        state Computer {
            direction LR
            Error
        }
    ```
The feedback from the sensor allows the controller to make real-time adjustments to the motor commands based on the actual performance of the system. This is done by adjusting the control signal from the computer based on the calculated error.
