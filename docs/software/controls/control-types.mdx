# Control Theory
Control theory is a branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the
behavior of dynamical systems. Its main goal is to develop models and control
strategies that ensure desired system behavior.

- **Setpoint**: Desired value or state for system to reach. Is typically some
real world measurable value.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint:::highlight
    ```
- **Computer/Controller**: Primary control unit for the system. Performs all
calculations for desired command based of the requested setpoint.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer:::highlight
    ```
- **Motor/Actuator**: Actuator for the system that is used to change the
current state of the system.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor:::highlight
    ```
- **Output**: Effect the control has on the system. The reaction of the system
from the applied command to the motor.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output:::highlight
    ```
- **Sensor**: Device that measures the true output of the system. Allows you to
checking what is happening and react instead of instructing the system blindly.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
        Output --> Sensor:::highlight
        Sensor --> Computer
    ```
- **Measurement**: Device that measures the true output of the system. Allows
you to checking what is happening and react instead of instructing the system
blindly.
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Computer
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
        Output --> Measurement:::highlight
        Measurement --> Computer

        state Sensor {
            direction LR
            Measurement
        }
    ```
- **Error**: Difference between the setpoint and the sensor measurement. This
is what the controller uses to determine how to adjust the output.
$$
Error = Setpoint - Measurement
$$
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        direction LR
        classDef highlight font-weight:bold,stroke:red,stroke-width:2px;

        Setpoint --> Error
        Computer --> Motor
        Motor --> Output
        Output --> Measurement
        Measurement --> Error:::highlight

        state Sensor {
            direction LR
            Measurement
        }

        state Computer {
            direction LR
            Error
        }
    ```
