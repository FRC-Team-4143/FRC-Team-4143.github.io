# Operators
Operators are symbols used to preform data manipulation and assignment. They allow us to preform math with our variables and change what values are stored in them. Operators only work with a specific types. For examples you cant multiple a `String`.

## Arithmetic

## Assignment
You should be familiar with the `=` operator by now, but there are several more assignment operators that we can use in our code.
Below is a table which shows most of the available assignment operators.

<table>
<tr>
{/* Column Titles */}
<td> Operator </td>
<td> Description </td>
<td> Example </td>
<td> Equivalent Expression </td>
</tr>
<tr>
{/* = operator */}
<td> `=` </td>
<td> Assignment </td>
<td> Assigns a value (right side) to a variable (left side) </td>
<td> `int x = 0;` </td>
<td> `int x = 0;` </td>
</tr>
<tr>
{/* += operator */}
<td> `+=` </td>
<td> Addition Assignment </td>
<td>

```java
int x = 1;
x += 1; // x is now 2
```

</td>
<td> `x = x + 1;` </td>
</tr>
{/* -= operator */}
<tr>
<td> `-=` </td>
<td> Subtraction Assignment </td>
<td>

```java
double x = 3.14;
x -= 0.14;  // x is now 3.0
```

</td>
<td> `x = x - 0.14;` </td>
</tr>
{/* *= operator */}
<tr>
<td> *= </td>
<td>Multiplication Assignment </td>
<td>

```java
int x = 2;
x *= 6;  // x is now 12
```

</td>
<td> `x = x * 6;` </td>
</tr>
{/* /= operator */}
<tr>
<td> `/=` </td>
<td> Division Assignment </td>
<td>

```java
int x = 9;
x /= 3;  // x is now 3
```

</td>
<td> `x = x / 3;` </td>
</tr>
