# Loops
Loops are another fundamental structure to programming. 
They allow us to repeat operations without copying lines of code over and over again.
Loops can repeat any number of <b>iterations</b>- the number of times the loop occurs for.

- Ex. 1: "adding 1 to x five times" implies the programmer set the number of iterations to 5.

- Ex. 2: "adding 1 to x until a 6-sided die lands on 1" implies there is no <i>exact</i> number of iterations until the loop ends.


Both situations for loops are valuable for different situations, so it's important to know how and when to use them.
There are three types of loops in Java: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

## For

The `for` loop allows for lines of code to be <i>iterated</i> a set number of times:

```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 6; i++) {
    System.out.println("Redbird");
}
```

In this case, the word "Redbird" gets printed seven times, each on a separate line.

## While

The `while` loop iterates until a boolean condition is met. 
This allows for more versatility at the cost of more responsibility for making sure the while loop is able to reach its break condition.

:::danger Break Condition

When using `while`-loops, make <b>complete</b> sure that you have a break condition, and that the break condition will be reached by your code.
Not doing so runs the risk of creating an <b>infinite-while loop</b>, which can leave your programming environment and/or entire computer unresponsive.
Another common method is to implement a `KeyListener` that exits your program in case you run into a long or unresponsive state.
If you're running your code through a console or terminal, you can also use `CTRL + C` to exit an active program.
:::

```java
int i = 0;
while (i <= 6) {
    System.out.println("Iteration #" + i);
    i++;
}
```

In this case, the while-loop prints seven lines in total, and we use the variable `i` to keep track of the total number of iterations.
Notice the `i++;` line: it's recommended to update your iteration variable at the <i>bottom</i> of your loop for consistency.

## Do-While
Unlike most programming languages, Java offers a `do-while` loop. This structure runs the code in the block <i>once</i> before checking the condition, and otherwise acts as a `while` loop.
This is only practical in specific situations, so you'll typically use `for` and `while` for looping.
Rewriting do-while loops to use while instead is a fair option, since do-while isn't commonplace among all programming languages.

```java
do {
    System.out.println("This will run at least once!")
} while (0 > 1)
```

:::tip Index Conventions
It is recommended to reserve the single-letter variables `i, j, k` as indices for loops, as this is the industry standard.
While any variable name is technically allowed, using anything else makes your code harder to reader by other programmers.
