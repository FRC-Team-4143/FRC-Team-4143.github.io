# Java Programming Standards

## Comments
- All methods should be commented following java doc styling. Make sure to include any parameters or return members. Example is show below:
```java
/**
 * Calculates the chassis traveled distance based on provided speed and duration
 *
 * @param speed current chassis speed (m/s)
 * @param time duration of travel (s)
 *
 * @return traveled distance (m)
 */
double calculateDistance(double speed, double time){
    return speed * time;
}
```

## Variables
- All variables should be named using `snake_case`. Examples are shown below:
    ```java
    double current_elevator_position
    int final_counter
    boolean is_enabled
    float error
    ```
- Variables belonging to a class ***(or members)*** should have a trailing underscore `_`. Examples are shown below:
    ```java
    double current_elevator_position_
    int final_counter_
    boolean is_enabled_
    float error_
    ```

## Loops
- Never use `while` loops
    - They are dangerous in a controls application and could result in a infinite loop if not updated correctly.
- Iterators for a `for` loops should be used in order of `i`, `j`, and then `k`.
    - If the iterator is used external to the `for` it should be named something unique to its purpose.
