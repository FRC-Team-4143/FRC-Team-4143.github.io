# Java Programming Standards

## Comments
- All methods should be commented following java doc styling. Make sure to include any parameters or return members. Example is show below:
    ```java
    /**
     * Calculates the chassis traveled distance based on provided speed and duration
     *
     * @param speed current chassis speed (m/s)
     * @param time duration of travel (s)
     *
     * @return traveled distance (m)
     */
    double calculateDistance(double speed, double time){
        return speed * time;
    }
    ```

## Variables
- All variables should be named using `snake_case`. Examples are shown below:
    ```java
    double current_elevator_position;
    int final_counter;
    boolean is_enabled;
    float error;
    ```
- Variables belonging to a class ***(or members)*** should have a trailing underscore `_`. Examples are shown below:
    ```java
    double current_elevator_position_;
    int final_counter_;
    boolean is_enabled_;
    float error_;
    ```
- Variables that are constant should be named using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. The should also use the `final` and `static` modifiers to prevent accidental updates and multiple instances. Examples are shown below:
    ```java
    static final double ELEVATOR_HOME_POSITION;
    static final int COUNTER_RESET;
    static final boolean IS_MOTOR_INVERTED;
    static final float I_TERM_ERROR_MAX;
    ```

## Enums
- Both the Enum name and the fields should be named using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. Example shown below:
    ```java
    enum STATE {
        IDLE,
        SCORE,
        HOME,
        TRAVELING_UP,
        TRAVELING_DOWN
    }
    ```

## Methods / Functions
- Methods should be named using `lowerCamelCase`. Examples are shown below:
    ```java
    void setElevatorVoltage(double volts){
        motor.set(volts);
    }

    int getElevatorVoltage(){
        return volts;
    }
    ```
- Methods that are just updating or returning members should prefix with `set` or `get` Examples shown below:
    ```java
    double target = 0;

    void setTarget(double value){
        target = value;
    }

    double getTarget(){
        return target;
    }
    ```
- The opening curly brace `{` for a method should be on the same line as the method signature. Examples shown below:
    ```java
    // This is correct formatting
    void doThisThing(){
        // Method code here
    }

    // Do not do this, this is incorrect formatting
    void dontDoThisThing()
    {
        // Method code here
    }
    ```
    :::info Single line methods
    This is only ok when a method is a single line
    ```java
    double getThatThing(){ return that_thing; }
    ```
    :::

## Loops
- Never use `while` loops
    - They are dangerous in a controls application and could result in a infinite loop if not updated correctly.
- Iterators for a `for` loops should be used in order of `i`, `j`, and then `k`.
    - If the iterator is used external to the `for` it should be named something unique to its purpose.
