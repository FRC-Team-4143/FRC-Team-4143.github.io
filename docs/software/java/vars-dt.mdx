# Variables and Datatypes
Variables are a core concept in any programming language. Think of them as a container to store a single piece of data. You need to define what type of data you will put into the container and give it a name. Variables should be named to easily identify what they contain.

### Declaring a Variable
You can create a variable without assigning a value to it. You would do this is you plan on using it, but do not have a value to assign at creation. The syntax is `[type] [name]` which can be seen is examples below.
```java
int team_number;
double pi;
boolean robot_is_on;
String message;
```
:::warning[Always assign a default value]
It can be dangerous leaving a variable unassigned at creation. You may know that you can't read it until it has a value, but if other developers are unaware and may read from it before its assigned. This can cause the code to error or crash.

### Assigning a Variable
When you define a variable you are assigning it a value to store. The syntax for this is `[name] = [value]` which can be seen in examples below.
```java
team_number = 4143;
pi = 3.14;
robot_is_on = true;
message = "I am a string!";
```
:::tip[Declaring and Assigning]
You can actually declare and assign a value to a variable in a single line. This is the preferred process since it will ensure the variable has a default value at the start of the program. This is done with the syntax `[type] [name] = [value]`.
```java
int team_number = 4143
```

### Datatypes
You have seen a few of them already in the examples above, but there are plenty of datatypes in Java. A datatype is the type of data that will be referenced and in this case stored in our variables. Below is a list of a few common types that we use in our robot programs.
| Datatype | Description | Example |
|--|--|--|
| `int` | A non-decimal number | `int team_number = 4143;` |
| `double` | A decimal number | `double pi = 3.14;` |
| `boolean` | A value that is either true or false | `boolean robot_is_on = true;` |
| `String` | A list of characters (a.k.a. text) *note the capitalization in `String`| `String message = "I am a string!";` |
