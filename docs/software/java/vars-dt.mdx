# Variables and Datatypes
Variables are a core concept in any programming language. Think of them as a container to store a single piece of data. You need to define what type of data you will put into the container and give it a name. Variables should be named to easily identify what they contain.

## Declaring a Variable
You can create a variable without assigning a value to it. You would do this is you plan on using it, but do not have a value to assign at creation. The syntax is `[type] [name]` which can be seen is examples below.
```java
int team_number;
double pi;
boolean robot_is_on;
String message;
```
:::warning[Always assign a default value]
It can be dangerous leaving a variable unassigned at creation. You may know that you can't read it until it has a value, but if other developers are unaware and may read from it before its assigned. This can cause the code to error or crash.

:::tip Naming convention
When naming a variable try to stick to the team naming standard. For a typical variable that is using `snake_case` which is shown in the example above.

## Assigning a Variable
When you define a variable you are assigning it a value to store. The syntax for this is `[name] = [value]` which can be seen in examples below.
```java
team_number = 4143;
pi = 3.14;
robot_is_on = true;
message = "I am a string!";
```
:::tip[Declaring and Assigning]
You can actually declare and assign a value to a variable in a single line. This is the preferred process since it will ensure the variable has a default value at the start of the program. This is done with the syntax `[type] [name] = [value]`.
```java
int team_number = 4143;
```

## Datatypes
You have seen a few of them already in the examples above, but there are plenty of datatypes in Java. A datatype is the type of data that will be referenced and in this case stored in our variables. Below is a list of a few common types that we use in our robot programs.
<table>
<tr>
{/* Column Titles */}
<td> **Datatype** </td>
<td> **Description** </td>
<td> **Example** </td>
</tr>
<tr>
{/* int */}
<td style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: 20}}> `int` </td>
<td> A non-decimal number </td>
<td>
```java
int team_number = 4143;
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
{/* double */}
<td style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: 20}}> `double` </td>
<td> A decimal number </td>
<td>
```java
double pi = 3.1415
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
{/* boolean */}
<td style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: 20}}> `boolean` </td>
<td> A value that is either true or false </td>
<td>
```java
boolean robot_is_on = true;
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
{/* String */}
<td style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: 20}}> `String` </td>
<td> A list of characters (a.k.a. text) *note the capitalization in `String` </td>
<td>
```java
String message = "I am a string!";
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Enums
If we wanted to create our own "datatype" with a fixed set of values we can create a `enum`. This is a special data type that allows for the definition of a fixed set of named values. We may want to use these to represent a system state or mode.
```java
enum STATE {
    IDLE,
    SCORE,
    HOME,
    TRAVELING_UP,
    TRAVELING_DOWN
}
```
A variable can be created to store a type of your custom `enum`. You can then reference the members of the enum for assignments and conditions. Think about how a `double` datatype can only represent a decimal number and must be compared to decimal numbers. It doesn't make sense to compare a `double` to a `String` because there is no meaningful comparison between `3.14` and `robot`. The same applies for our `enum`. You can see an example below of how it might be used.
```java
STATE current_state = STATE.IDLE;

if(current_state == STATE.SCORE){
    // Do scoring action!
}
```
Sure we could use `ints` to represent our states where 0 is `IDLE`, 1 is `SCORE`, 2 is `HOME`..., but this makes our code easier to understand and much more readable to a unfamiliar developer.
:::tip Under the Hood
The above "use `ints` to represent our states" comment is actually what the enum is doing under the hood. You can actually use an enum to represent anything you would like. Check out our [2025 robot code](https://github.com/FRC-Team-4143/mainbot-2025/blob/develop/src/main/java/frc/lib/ElevatorTargets.java) where we use it to store elevator targets including all of the height/angle information. This gave us an easy way to organize and reference all of our elevator target throughout the code.

## Constants
Variables that are never changed and are used in fundamental calculations / settings are called constants. We can add the `final` keyword in front of the datatype to "lock" the variable. The `final` keyword ensures that changes cannot be made to the variable accidentally. Constants are also typically named using `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`;
```java
final double PI = 3.14159265;
final double WHEEL_BASE = 0.34;
final int SHOOTER_MOTOR_ID = 10;
```
