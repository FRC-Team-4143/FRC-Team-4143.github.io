# Version Control with Git and GitHub


## Git
We use a tool called *git* for version control. This allows us to take "snapshots" of our code at a given time and save it for development documentation, reference, and backups. Git is a very powerful tool, but can be confusing and difficult to master. It also allows for simultaneous development across peers which is very helpful when multiple people are working on the same project.

Git can get very complicated and the best way to learn is by using it. You can read all the documentation you want, but until you actually use it, you won't really understand how it works. The best way to learn is to start using it and make mistakes. Don't be afraid to break things, that's how you learn! If you do break something, don't worry, we have backups and can help you fix it.

Make sure to read our documentation for a short brief, but I would recommend using an interactive tutorial like [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). These will help you get a feel for how git works and how to use it effectively.

#### Repos
A project that is tracked by git is called a *repository* or frequently shortened to *repo*. A repo is the file structure containing all the "code" used for the project. It also contains all git tracking information. It needs to know about all the [commits](#commits) and [branches](#branches) being made by all developers on the project to correctly update your local copy. Each programming project should live in its own repo. All of your robot projects are their own repo. We also several other repos for generic projects like this website!

#### Commits
The snapshots of your repo at a given moment of development is called a commits. Commits are a unique point in development that show the state of all tracked files in your repo. They are uniquely assigned a SHA, which is a long string of alpha-numeric characters. Something like `2c37172285088188fc6e7f100bc204fc4d6c446f` or `7a02abb2d621edc25a11c5869d9e6cb792c92580`. As you can see those are definitely unique, but not very helpful if we are trying to figure how what state the repo was in for that given commit. Luckily our buddy [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) had that in mind and allowed us to attach a "commit message" to describe what the state of the repo was in for that given commit.

Good version control practice is to commit frequently, but not after every line of code. Think about the big picture. Did I just complete a small development task? Did I just fix a bug? Did I just create the structure for a new feature? If so you should probably commit. The idea is that your commits act as breadcrumbs and could show your development process. 500+ line commits don't help anyone and can make it more difficult to figure out what you actually changed. A good rule of thumb is if you can't summarize your changes in less than 52 characters, your commit is too big.

Below is an example of a simple commit tree. Each commit is represented by a circle with a commit message associated with it. As you can see, the commit messages are short and to the point, but still give a good idea what was changed in the commit. They are also frequent enough to show the development process, but not so frequent that they are overwhelming.

#### Branches
Branches are a way to create a separate line of development in your repo. This is useful for developing new features or fixing bugs without affecting the main line of development. The main branch is usually called `main` or `master`, but you can create as many branches as you want. Each branch has its own commits and can be merged back into the main branch when the development is complete.

When you create a new branch, it starts at the current commit of the branch you are on. You can then make changes and commit them to the new branch without affecting the main branch. When you are ready to merge your changes back into the main branch, you can do so with a pull request or by merging the branch directly.

Branches allows us to work as a team without stepping on each other's toes. If you are working on a new feature, you can create a branch for that feature and work on it without affecting the main branch. When you are done, you can merge your changes back into the main branch and everyone else can pull those changes down to their local copy of the repo.

Below is an example of a branch tree. As you can see there are two branches made from the main branch. Each branch has its own commits and can be merged back into the main branch when the development is complete. The branch names are also short and to the point, but still give a good idea what was changed in the branch.
