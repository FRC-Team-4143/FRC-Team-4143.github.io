The REV Robotics Spark MAX Motor Controller is a popular brushed and brushless motor controller
used in FRC robots. It supports both brushed and brushless motors, and offers a variety of control
modes including percent output, velocity, and position control. The Spark MAX also includes advanced
features such as integrated PID control, and CAN bus communication.

Rev Robotics also supports a newer motor controller called the Spark Flex which is designed to act as
an integrated motor controller for the neo vortex motors. We have found in prior seasons however
that the Spark Flex is unable to produce significant torque at low RPMs which makes it unsuitable for
our applications.
