The ThriftyBot Nova Motor Controller is an alternative brushed and brushless motor controller
designed for FRC robots. Similar to the Spark Max from REV Robotics, the Nova supports both
brushed and brushless motors, and offers a variety of control modes including percent output,
velocity, and position control. The Nova also includes advanced features such as integrated PID
control, and CAN bus communication.
