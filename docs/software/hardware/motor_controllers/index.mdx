# Motor Controllers
Motor controllers are essential components in FRC robots, responsible for regulating the power delivered to motors based on commands from the robot's control system. They enable precise control over motor speed, direction, and torque, allowing for smooth and responsive robot operation. Functionally, motor controllers act as intermediaries between the robot's main processor and the motors themselves, interpreting control signals and adjusting the electrical output accordingly.

We commonly use the following motor controllers on our robots:
- [Talon FX](fx.mdx)
- [Thrifty Nova](nova.mdx)
- [Spark MAX](spark.mdx)

Each of these motor controllers offers unique features and capabilities, making them suitable for different applications within our robot designs. For detailed information on each motor controller, please refer to the individual documentation pages linked above.

Different types of control signal communication are used by these motor controllers, including [PWM](../../comms/pwm.mdx) and [CAN](../../comms/can.mdx) bus. CAN bus communication is preferred for its robustness and ability to support multiple devices on a single network.
