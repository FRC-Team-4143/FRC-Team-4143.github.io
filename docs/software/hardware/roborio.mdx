# RoboRio
The RoboRio is the main compute system used in FRC robots. It is responsible for running the robot code, managing communication between various subsystems, and interfacing with sensors and actuators on the robot. The RoboRio is a embedded system that provides a robust platform for developing and deploying robot software. Check the WPILib documentation for a more detailed [overview](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-introduction.html).
