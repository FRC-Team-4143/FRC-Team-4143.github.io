# Nvidia Jetson Vision Computer

The Nvidia Jetson is a small form-factor computer used for vision processing in our FRC robots. It is responsible for 
processing images from the cameras mounted on the robot and providing data to the RoboRio for autonomous actions. The 
Jetson runs an Ubuntu Linux-based operating system and nominally runs our AprilTag detection software during matches.
It also often runs other vision processing tasks such as game piece detection.

It can be accessed over SSH when connected to the robot's network.
