# Digital I/O
Digital I/O allows the robot controller to interact with basic digital signals. Digital signals are binary in nature, meaning they can only be in one of two states: HIGH or LOW.
A HIGH state typically represents a voltage level of 5V, while a LOW state represents 0.

## Digital Inputs
Digital Inputs are used to read the state of a digital signal. They are commonly used to read the state of simple sensors like switches that are either on or off, or read the speed 
or relative position of a Quadrature Encoder. Quadrature encoders provide two digital signals that can be used to determine the relative position and direction of rotation of a shaft.
Currently our robots do not use digital inputs, but they are available if needed in the future.

## Digital Outputs
Digital Outputs are used to send a digital signal to another device. In FRC robots, digital outputs may be used to control simple devices like LEDs or to send signals to other devices
that may require a digital input. Currently our robots do not use digital outputs, but they are available if needed in the future.
