# Control Theory
Control theory is a branch of engineering and mathematics that deals with the behavior of dynamical systems. The main goal of control theory is to develop models and strategies to influence the behavior of these systems to achieve desired outcomes. In the context of FRC robotics, control theory is essential for designing systems that can respond accurately and efficiently to changing conditions on the field. In this module, we will explore some fundamental concepts of control theory that are relevant to FRC robots.

- [Arm Tuning Exercise](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/tuning-vertical-arm.html)
- Tune the flywheel for velocity control on the Onboarding Bot
    - Tune in Simulation first to get a rough estimation
    - Make sure your system measurements like MOI and radius are close to the real robot
        - Wheel Radius: 3.5 in
        - Wheel Mass: 2.3 kg
    - Once you have tuned in simulation try final values on the robot
