## Exercises
- Have an understanding of Robot Hardware and Software Tools
- Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) if you don't already have one.
- Join the [FRC Team 4143 GitHub Organization](https://github.com/FRC-Team-4143)
- Complete all Levels in [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
    - There are Two Levels Tabs: "Main" and "Remote". Make sure to complete both! Start with "Main".
    - There is **NO** account, so progress can't be saved across computers. Take pictures of your progress if needed when leaving computers.
