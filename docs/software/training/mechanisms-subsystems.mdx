# Mechanisms and Subsystems
In this module, we will explore the concept of mechanisms and subsystems in FRC robots. Unlike traditional subsystem-based designs, we will focus on a modular approach that allows for reusable components. This method emphasizes the creation of mechanisms that can be easily integrated into different subsystems, promoting flexibility and efficiency in robot design.
