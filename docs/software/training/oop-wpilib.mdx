# Object Oriented Programming and WPILib
In this module we will cover the basics of Object Oriented Programming. This will include creating classes, methods, and using objects. We will then cover some of the WPILib classes used for controlling a differential drive robot, including kinematics and odometry. Finally, we will cover how to simulate a differential drive robot using WPILib's simulation tools.

## Exercises
### Classes
- Create an abstract OI class
    - Add a getter for a joystick Y axis
    - Add a getter for a joystick X axis
- Update your code to use the OI class methods and remove the XboxController from Robot.java
### Objects
- Create a Drivetrain Class
    - Create the class in a new folder called “subsystems”
    - Move all content related to your drivetrain and its methods to the new class
    - Your readInputs and writeOutputs should now be your primary methods
    - Add a new method to reset wheel encoders
    - Add a new helper method to convert from ticks to meters
- Create a Drivetrain Object in Robot
    - Use it to call readInputs and writeOutputs in robotPeriodic
    - Use it to call arcadeDrive in teleopPeriodic and autonomousPeriodic
    - Use it to call getDistance in autonomous
### WPILib
- Create a [DifferentialDrive](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.html) Object
    - Use the [arcadeDrive](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.html#arcadeDrive(double,double)) method to drive the robot in auto/tele
- Create a [DifferentKinematics](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/kinematics/DifferentialDriveKinematics.html) Object
    - Write a getChassisSpeeds methods
    - Use this object to get the [ChassisSpeeds](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/kinematics/ChassisSpeeds.html) of the robot
- Create a [DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/estimator/DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator.html) Object
    - Publish the estimated pose to NetworkTables
    - Use the x segment from the estimated pose for auto drive distance
### Simulation
- Setup a [DifferentialDrivetrainSim](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/simulation/DifferentialDrivetrainSim.html) Object
    - Add a [Rotation2d](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/geometry/Rotation2d.html) based calculation for yaw in simulation
    - Drive the robot in simulation using AdvantageScope!
