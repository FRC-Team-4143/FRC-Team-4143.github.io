# Autonomous
Autonomous programming is a critical aspect of FRC robots, as it covers the first 15 seconds of the match where the robot operates without human intervention. During this period,
the robot must perform a series of pre-programmed actions to score points, navigate the field, and interact with game pieces. Effective autonomous routines can provide a significant
advantage in matches, as they allow the robot to maximize the points scored during this crucial phase where activity scores are higher.

# Excercises
## Accuracy and Precision
- Create a way to turn to a specific heading
- Create a way to drive ***straight*** a specific distance
- Create dynamic commands for these actions
   - driveDistance(double distance)
   - turnToAngle(Rotation2d angle)
## Command Sequences
- Create an Auto that does the following: (Left Auto)
   - Drive forward 5 meters (0 Heading) 
   - Turn 45 degrees
   - Drive forward 2 meters (45 Heading)
   - Shoot
- Create an Auto that does the following: (Right Auto)
   - Drive forward 5 meters (0 Heading)
   - Turn -45 degrees
   - Drive forward 2 meters (-45 Heading)
   - Shoot
## Auto Manager
- Add both Autos to the Sendable Chooser
- Test both Autos in Simulation
   - Test on robot if everything looks correct
