## Exercises
### Methods
- Write methods to convert the encoder inputs usable outputs
    - translation position in m
    - translation speed in m/s
    - rotation position in radians
    - rotation speed in rads/s
- Write methods to set the speed drive motors
    - setting the left motor only
    - setting the right motor only
    - method that performs the math of arcade drive and sets the motors (using above methods)
- Write methods to update the inputs and outputs following the IO model
### WPILib
- Create a [DifferentialDrive](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.html) Object
    - Use the [arcadeDrive](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.html#arcadeDrive(double,double)) method to drive the robot in auto/tele
- Create a [DifferentKinematics](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/kinematics/DifferentialDriveKinematics.html) Object
    - Write a getChassisSpeeds methods
    - Use this object to get the [ChassisSpeeds](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/kinematics/ChassisSpeeds.html) of the robot
- Create a [DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/estimator/DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator.html) Object
    - Publish the estimated pose to NetworkTables
    - Use the x segment from the estimated pose for auto drive distance
### Simulation
- Setup a [DifferentialDrivetrainSim](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/simulation/DifferentialDrivetrainSim.html) Object
    - Add a [Rotation2d](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/math/geometry/Rotation2d.html) based calculation for yaw in simulation
    - Drive the robot in simulation using AdvantageScope!
