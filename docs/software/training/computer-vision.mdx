# Computer Vision
Computer vision is a subset of algorthims and techniques that allow computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. The main goal is to develop methods to detect and track objects, recognize patterns, and extract meaningful information from visual data.
In the context of FRC, computer vision is often used to help robots identify and interact with game pieces, and or field elements. It helps the robots better understand the environment around them, enabling more autonomous and intelligent behavior.
