In this training module, we will explore the various sensors commonly used in FRC robots. 
We will also cover how to read data from these sensors and use that data to provide feedback for
robot control in our software.

## Exercises
### Sensors
- Show chassis speeds on SmartDashboard
    - Linear speed in m/s (forward / backward)
    - Angular speed in rad/s (rotation)
- Show distance traveled by driving on SmartDashboard
    - Use encoders to measure distance
### Feedback
- Implement a simple Bang Bang controller to drive a set distance
    - Use encoders to measure distance
    - Use a constant speed until the robot reaches the target distance
