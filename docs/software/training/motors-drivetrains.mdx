In this training module, we will explore the various motors and drivetrains commonly used in FRC robots. 
We will also cover how to control these motors through programming in Java using WPILib.

## Exercises
- Spin a brushed motor using a motor controller and a joystick from your own code.
- Set up a leader and a follower motor controller configuration in code.
- Move motors on both sides of a tank drive drivetrain to drive forward, backward, and turn.
    - For an extra challenge, try to implement arcade drive controls!
