### General Safety

- **Personal**
    - Loose Clothing
        - All clothing—including pants, shirts, jackets, and sweatshirts—must fit closely to the body and not hang loosely into work areas. **Pay particular attention to drawstrings**, which can pose a serious hazard if left unsecured.
    - Closed Toed Shoes
        - **Closed-toe shoes are required at all times in the engineering lab.** Open-toe footwear—including sandals, flip-flops, and clogs—are strictly prohibited due to the risk of hot chips, falling objects, and other physical and chemical hazards.
    - Jewelry
        - **Jewelry can pose a serious safety hazard.** Remove rings, unsecured necklaces, loose bracelets, and watches before machining due to the risk of getting caught in machinery or conducting electricity.
    - Safety Glasses
        - Safety glasses must be worn while work is being performed in a close proximity. This is to protect against flying debris. **Regular glasses are not a suitable replacement for safety glasses.**
    - Long Hair
        - **Long hair must be securely restrained** before entering a work area. Hair longer than shoulder length must be tied back, secured with a cap, or bandanna. This is to prevent entanglement in machinery. Loose ponytails or unsecured strands are not acceptable.

- **Behavior**
    - Horseplay
        - Pranks, physical contact, and distraction can lead to serious injuries and are strictly forbidden in the Engineering Lab.
    - Distractions
        - While actively machine avoid the use of mobile devices to distract yourself or others.

- **House Keeping**
    - Clean Debris
        - Remove chips and debris regularly using brushes or tools—not bare hands. (Floor, Machines, Work Tables)
    - Store tools
        - Don’t leave tools on machines; use designated storage areas.
    - Clean Spills
        - Prevent slips and contamination by cleaning immediately.

- **Emergency Awareness**    (Add maps and pictures)
    - Emergency Stops
        - Before working with or approaching an piece of active machinery identify emergency stops.
        - In cases where there are no emergency stops identify what to do in case of an emergency.
    - Safety Equipment
        - Locate the shop's fire extinguished, first aid kit, and eye wash station.
        - Locate fire alarms and posted evacuation plans in case of an emergency.
